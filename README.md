This is my Web Development portfolio

I am a self-taught web developer that is very passionate about learning and creating new and innovative web applications.

I am currently looking for my first web development job and am very excited to get to know anyone and everyone that shares the same passion for creating unique and useful technologies just like I enjoy. 
I am also very interested in learning new technologies and increasing my understanding of the technologies that I use and will use in the furure. This is why after I learned front end technologies I am now in the process of learning back-end technologies. 

My portfolio currently shows off some of the projects that I have completed. As I continue to learn and grow I will continue to make changes and improve my portfolio as I develop new skills.

If anyone finds any issues with my portfolio or any of the applications that I have created please let me know so that I can fix them.
